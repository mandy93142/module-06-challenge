Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
d
## Overview
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Search Bar:** Search for a city and the 5 day weather forecast of the city will show.
- **Search History:** The city that the user searched before will appear on the page for future use. 

## Technologies

- **HTML, CSS, JS:** Basic web technologies.
- **OpenWeather API:** Retrieve weather data for cities.
- **localStorage:** Save the user's previous searches and store it in localStorage.

## Project Files

- **index.html:** Web page structure.
- **style.css:** Styling.
- **script.js:** Content and API requests.
